# SoC-Advances-in-Nuclear-Fusion

Fusion is the nuclear process that occurs in stars, due to lightweight atoms fusing together. This releases a lot of energy. Currently a lot of research is going on to devise mechanisms to harness this energy on Earth in a controlled manner. The potential advantages of nuclear fusion energy include long-term, sustainable, economic and safe energy source for electricity generation. Fuel is inexpensive and abundant in nature, while the amount of long-lived radioactive waste and greenhouse gases produced through fusion are minimal.

This project is to gain an understanding of the fundamentals of nuclear fusion and explore some of the research areas currently being worked on. It is a learning project and does not involve much coding. The files used during the course of the project have been uploaded in this repository. Due to time constraints, I was unable to complete all that I wanted to, but in the future I will be taking this forward by learning more about nuclear materials and advances in material technology for reactors such as ceramics, metals, graphene etc. for coatings and practice plotting in scientific journal standards.

### File Details

- **Progress.md** - Datewise work updates on the project  
- **Practice Codes** - Python codes done for practice from various sources (References attached)
- **Graph Similarity** - Code to determine whether two sets of points belong to the same distribution with a certain threshold
- **Reports and Notes** - Summary reports made for the papers I read (References attached) and general notes taken from other resources provided by the mentor
